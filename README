PGP
===

This is a very simple plugin for a simple algorithm that's often vastly over-complexified.  It takes
only a few relatively simple steps, and you too can be using strong encryption just like the pros
at PGP!  

This plugin requires openssl to be installed.

Simply generate a key pair with the rake task (you may want to alter some of the params in the task),
and then use those key files in your program.  The relative size of the encrypted string will be 
proportional to the bit length of your keys.  

Enjoy!

Example
=======

`rake pgp:generate_key_pair`


p = PGP.new('pass')
p.public_key # just to see it

p.encrypt('A very secret string')
